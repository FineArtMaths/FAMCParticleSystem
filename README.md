# FAMCParticleSystem
Code examples for the particle system tutorial on the FAMC blog at http://maths.myblog.arts.ac.uk.

Please note this is educational code showing how a project might proceed from initial idea to a very basic prototype and illustrating various things like classes and arrays along the way. So Particle01 is extremely basic and they gradually develop from there.

This is not a finished product, nor is it intended to be. Lots of proper particle systems for Processing already exist; this is not one of them. But it might help you follow along with the blog posts if you're trying to learn this stuff.
