# FAMCParticleSystem
Code examples for the particle system tutorials for Central Saint Martins art/coding students. The web resources accompanying them no longer exist but the code might still be useful to somebody.

Please note this is educational code showing how a project might proceed from initial idea to a very basic prototype and illustrating various things like classes and arrays along the way. So Particle01 is extremely basic and they gradually develop from there. This was a learning process for the students, not a finished product; lots of proper particle systems for Processing already exist.
